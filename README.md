# Correlation-based-Recommender-System
I have created a movie recommendation system based on correlations. As the system works on the ratings given by the users for each movie, it can be classified as Collaborative filtering system.

Created a basic Collaborative filtering recommender system which provides recommendations based on correlations. The system creates correlations based on the user ratings for all the movies. If a movie is provided to the system, it will list out all the users that have rated that movie and find correlations of the same user with different movies. Then, based on the correlation score, the system will fetch back the top results to the user. Successfully tested it on movies like star wars and liar liar.
